# PersonalProject
COP 2001 Personal Project Raspberry PI 3 B+

## Problem Statement:

Need a Rasberry PI project for COP 2001.
First need to research projects that can be done with in the 6 weeks of our course.
Looking into the posibility of building a line following robot.
Ideal situation would be to be able to use the rasberry PI 3 B+ to build the robot.

## Outline Goals:

Find all the parts neccessary to buil the robot.
Learn Python to be able to program the robot to follow a line.
Provide weekly updates to stay on task to complete within 6 weeks.

## Chart Boundaries:

Need to use Rasberry PI as a platform for personal project.

## Define Success Criteria:

- Obtain Rasberry PI - Done
- Configure and get Rasberry PI working - IW
- Download and install OS for PI - Done
- Flash SD card with OS - IW
- Get PI OS installed and working - 
- Obtain Robot parts list. - IW.
- Assemble Robot - 
- Program Line following software - 
- Incorporate software and hardware - 

## Determine Constraints:

- Need to get all required parts. - Amazon
- Need to buy Rasberry PI. - Done.
- Need to configure Rasberry PI. - IW.
- Need to learn Python. - Udemy - 
- Time line - 6 weeks

## Articulating Assumptions:

Can learn enough python to finish project.
By week six should have a working robot.

## Stake Holders:

Professor - project requirement.
Self - learning Rasberry PI and Python.
