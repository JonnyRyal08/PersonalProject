# PersonalProject
COP 2001 Personal Project Raspberry PI 3 B+

Problem Statement:

Need a Rasberry PI project for COP 2001.
First need to research projects that can be done with in the 6 weeks of our course.
Looking into the posibility of building a line following robot.
Ideal situation would be to be able to use the rasberry PI 3 B+ to build the robot.

Outline Goals:

Find all the parts neccessary to buil the robot.
Learn Python to be able to program the robot to follow a line.
Provide weekly updates to stay on task to complete within 6 weeks.

Chart Boundaries:

Need to use Rasberry PI as a platform for personal project.

Define Success Criteria:

- Obtain Rasberry PI - Done
- Configure and get Rasberry PI working - IW
- Download and install OS for PI - Done
- Flash SD card with OS - IW
- Get PI OS installed and working - 
- Obtain Robot parts list. - IW.
- Assemble Robot - 
- Program Line following software - 
- Incorporate software and hardware - 

Determine Constraints:

- Need to get all required parts. - Amazon
- Need to buy Rasberry PI. - Done.
- Need to configure Rasberry PI. - IW.
- Need to learn Python. - Udemy - 
- Time line - 6 weeks

Articulating Assumptions:

Can learn enough python to finish project.
By week six should have a working robot.

Stake Holders:

Professor - project requirement.
Self - learning Rasberry PI and Python.

Establish Timelines:

Week 1 - Pesearch all tools, parts, and code needed for project.

  Time Spent: 
  
  - 2hrs  Researching projects
  - 1hr   Researching purchasing PI and parts for project
  - 2hrs  Downloading and installing software on Rasberry PI
  - 1hr   Watching tutorials
  - 1hr   Practicing Python
  
  Lessons learned:
  - Learned advantages and disadvantages of Rasberry PI vs Arduino DUO
  - Learned about setting up Rasberry PI
  - Learned how to control single LED with Python on the PI    

Week 2 - Purchase all neccessary parts and start learning Python.

  Time Spent:
  
  - 1hr   Researched different manufactures and purchased more parts for Line Following Robot.
  - 1hr   Practice simple projects on Rasberry PI 
  - 2hr   Assembled robot with Rasberry PI and installed all sensors for project
  - 1hr   Researched required code to program bot. Found projects on https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/?interests[]=robotics to assist in developing code for bot.
  
  Lessons Learned:
  
  - Learned about assembly of PI board along with driver cards as well as interaction with Python to control specific features.
  

Week 3 - Start assembly of robot. Continue to program software for robot.

  Time Spent:
