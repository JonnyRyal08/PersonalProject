COP 2001 Personal Project Raspberry PI 3 B+

Problem Statement:

Need a Rasberry PI project for COP 2001.
First need to research projects that can be done with in the 6 weeks of our course.
Looking into the posibility of building a line following robot.
Ideal situation would be to be able to use the rasberry PI 3 B+ to build the robot.

Outline Goals:

Find all the parts neccessary to buil the robot.
Learn Python to be able to program the robot to follow a line.
Provide weekly updates to stay on task to complete within 6 weeks.

Chart Boundaries:

Need to use Rasberry PI as a platform for personal project.

Define Success Criteria:

Obtain Rasberry PI - Done
Configure and get Rasberry PI working - IW
  download and install OS for PI - Done
  flash SD card with OS - IW
  Get PI OS installed and working - 
Obtain Robot parts list. - IW.
Assemble Robot - 
Program Line following software - 
Incorporate software and hardware - 

Determine Constraints:

Need to get all required parts. - Amazon
Need to buy Rasberry PI. - Done.
Need to configure Rasberry PI. - IW.
Need to learn Python. - Udemy - 
Time line - 6 weeks

Articulating Assumptions:

Can learn enough python to finish project.
By week six should have a working robot.

Stake Holders:

Professor - project requirement.
Self - learning Rasberry PI and Python.

Establish Timelines:
